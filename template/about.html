Pardon me, what did you just say? Purpose? LOL! What purpose?

<h2>Questions</h2>
I guess some people will ask:
<h3>What is a valid word?</h3>
Basically a word must be <tt>[ \-a-zA-Z]{1,100}</tt>.
<h3>Why do some words repeatly show up?</h3>
This app doesn't store what words you have linked. At beginning of this app, the word bank is small, so you will get nuts more often.
<h3>What are the very beginning?</h3>
<strong>Start!</strong>
<h3>Do you store my personal information</h3>
No. But your IP will be kept upto an hour when you tried to link a word. If you do some thing weird, your IP probably will be logged.
<h3>May I spam this app?</h3>
Please don't try it! I beg you!
<h3>Why does this app look so ugly?</h3>
What you can expect from a dumb creator?
